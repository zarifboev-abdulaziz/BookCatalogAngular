## Development Setup

1. **Clone the frontend repository**: Ensure you have the latest version of the frontend code.
2. **Navigate to the project directory**: Use the terminal to access the project folder.
3. **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install` to fetch all required npm packages.
4. **Configure environment variables**: Set up the `.env` file with the backend API URL.
5. **Run the Angular development server**: Execute `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to view the app.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.3.


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
